### Initial setup

1. git clone `git@github.com:kamaal111/flappy-bird.git`
2. cd flappyBird
3. `npm install` to install dependencies


### Running and modifying Flappy Bird

Option A: `npm run web`

Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On your device, use the Expo app (or camera) to scan the QR code from your terminal (after running `npm run web`) to open your project. Your app should develop within the Expo app and it should update every time you save your files in the code editor.


Option B: `npm run ios`

Install Xcode for iOS and Android Studio for Android.
